# germangraph
a network graph of German vocabulary 

I am trying to build a graph of German words that are connected by root and meaning. The German language is particularly amenable to this sort of mapping, with its regular word stems and orderly transformations. I'm gonna go step by step and see whether it turns into a useful vocabulary learning tool.

The idea for this emerged from my ongoing language studies and my love of graph theory. Many famous polyglots apply similar techniques; for example Luca Lampariello calls it his [word spider web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZYOScgVc3g).

Current version is a graph of four clusters of verbs. The visualization is in d3 and taken from [Observable](https://observablehq.com/@d3/disjoint-force-directed-graph/2).

If anyone is interested in working with me, please raise an issue.
